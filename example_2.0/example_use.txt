This file shows how to use the stack_2.0.py script on a prepared example.

To use the code, you need three files: the code file [stack_2.0.py], the geometry file in xyz format [geom.xyz] and the file containing the specification of the atoms that make up the aromatic rings [bases-spec].
To use the code, run this command:

$ python3 stack_2.0.py -b bases-spec -x geom.xyz

The program will generate several files during its run. The main results will be saved in the stack.out file. The other files are temporary and can be deleted after the program has been successfully run. The base_n_ring_m.xyz files contain the xyz coordinates for each subunit of the ring. The pdf files contain images of the shape of the overlap region of all the rings.

The stacking score is provided in the stack.out file as "new stacking score". It is currently not normalized and can take values ​​from 0 to 2. The user can normalize it by dividing by 2 if necessary.

The stacking score calculated using the previous algorithm is still printed in the stack.out file as "old stacking score".
